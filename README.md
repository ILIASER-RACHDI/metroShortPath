Paris Metro Route Finder  
Overview
This repository contains a C program designed to simulate the Paris Metro system. Utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm, it calculates the shortest path between two stations. The program is an excellent demonstration of practical applications of graph theory and algorithms in real-world transportation networks.

Features  
Reads station and connection data from CSV files.
Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths.
Displays routes with estimated travel times.
User-friendly interface for interaction.
Special RATP logo display using ASCII art.
Installation
