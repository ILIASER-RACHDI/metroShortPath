# Paris Metro Route Finder
## Overview
This repository contains a C program designed to simulate the Paris Metro system. Utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm, it calculates the shortest path between two stations. The program is an excellent demonstration of practical applications of graph theory and algorithms in real-world transportation networks.

## Features  
Reads station and connection data from CSV files.
Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths.
Displays routes with estimated travel times.
User-friendly interface for interaction.
Special RATP logo display using ASCII art.
## Installation  
-Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ILIASER-RACHDI/metroShortPath.git  
-Navigate to the cloned directory: cd metroShortPath\Ratp  
-Compile the program: gcc Ratp.c -o Ratp  
-Run the program: ./Ratp 

## Usage  
-View Stations: List all stations in the network.  
-Find Shortest Path: Enter start and end station IDs to get the shortest route and travel time.   
-Exit: Terminate the program.
